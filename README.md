# ESP-51-Peg-b

Planets beyond our solar system are referred to as **exoplanets**. One way to detect these objects is by measuring the *radial
velocity* of their host star.


## About the project
In this project, we want to find out whether a particular star has a companion object, and if so, we want to estimate the probability that the companion object is a planet.

This project was part of a programming course on scientific data analysis, offered by the University of
Bonn and taught by Dr. Thomas Erben.

## About the data

The dataset in this repo contains the *radial velocity* of a star at various points in time and it was obtained from the [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/DisplayOverview/nph-DisplayOverview?objname=51+Peg+b&type=CONFIRMED_PLANET).

**The first column is the time in days, the second column is the radial velocity in m/s, and the third column is the uncertainty in the radial velocity in m/s.** The fourth column can be ignored.

## About the notebook
The Jupyter Notebook contains my solution for the determination of the radial
velocity of the host star, and the mass analysis for the extrasolar planet *51
Peg b*.
